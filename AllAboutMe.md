### _A Brief History on Anime_
![Collage featuring various anime characters](https://github.com/Keylith2020/Midterm-Project/blob/main/Anime%20photo.jpg) 
Anime is a vast medium, and this is a truth that has endured since it's very early days during 1916. The first animes were not made on Cels, or digitially produced using computers, but instead drawn using chalk. It was an explosive new medium that saw must interest during World War 1, more then **20 films** released in 1917 alone! It was around the 1940s that animation on Cels finally started, and this meant finally putting animation to film. This was a very time consuming and expensive process however, so lots of advertisments and promotional videos were made to help cover the costs. The anime to revolutionize the market as we know it was **Astro Boy** which premiered New Year's day 1963. This was a milestone in a mulitude of ways.

1. The first anime to debut on live television.
2. The first anime that was wildly available to the general public, as before you either needed to be rich or go to a theater to watch anime.
3. It set the standard for style that many anime still follow today. This includes
* Big, exaggerated features such as big eyes and stylized hair.
* Animation techniques such as reusing frames and static backgrounds to save on both costs and time.
* Anime coming out in a serialized, weekly format.  

From the 1960s to the 2000s, many series that would become mainstays in the culture were made, such as **Mobile Suit Gundam and Dragon Ball.** The next major shift in anime would happen in the early 2000s, as many studios switched from animating on cels to using digital software. And so, the modern age of anime was started.
### My Favorite Animes
I've complied a list of 5 anime that I feel are not only some of my personal favorites, but showcase why anime has endured for over a century, and why it's themes and Messages resonate with such a wide audience.
#### 1. Dragon Ball
![The first volume cover of Dragon Ball! Featuring Goku riding on the back of a dragon.][Goku]
By far the most popular show on this list, **Dragon Ball** is nothing short of a cultural icon worldwide. The story follows a boy named Goku, a boy with a tail who gets wrapped up in a journey to find the seven dragon balls after a chance meeting with Bulma. The author, Akira Toriyama, started the manga as a more comical take on traditional martial arts story telling. There are many gags thrown within the story, and the world and characters have a more rounded and silly look. It's not until the story reaches the Tenka'ichi Budokai arc where the story starts to turn more deadly, and more serious. Borrowing from his love of martial arts, _Toriyama_ crafts an intense adventure full of charming characters and awe-inspiring art. However,this part of the Dragon Ball story is not what it's revered worldwide for, it's the sequel [Dragon Ball Z](https://www.funimation.com/shows/dragon-ball-z-kai/). The sheer insanity of the series increases tenfold from this point on. Characters go from hand-to-hand martial arts combat to blowing up mountains with the wave of a hand.The setting, while remaining charming and colorful, starts taking itself more seriously. The story even moves from the bounds of Earth, as a major part of the story takes place on **an entirely different planet!** Despite the crazy shift in tone and action, the story of Goku and his struggles, successes, and failures still touch the hearts of many because of easy it is to be inspired by his strength, passion and courage. This was certaintly for me when I was younger, it was inspiring the way he managed to keep standing back up to reach his goals despite the opposition and turmoil he faced. It was inspiring that, despite his great strength and desire to fight, he still kept his kind heart and desire to care for the people around him. The dramatic moments, heartstopping action, vibrant world, and the message of working hard and never giving are the reasons why Dragon Ball is not only one of my favorite animes of all time, but why its endured as a cultural icon for the past 37 years.
#### 2. Saint Seiya
![The First volume cover of Saint Seiya! Featuring Seiya wearing the Pegasus Cloth][Seiya]
Of all the genres of anime, there is not one that is more popular then shounen. Shounen are manga/anime that are aimed at a younger male demographic. Lots of the tropes that can be found in these type of stories can be found in alot of the coming of age/ heroes journey stories that are popular in the west. One of the premiere shounens that came out during the 1980s is [Saint Seiya](https://www.netflix.com/title/70273371). It swung out of the gate with a very inspired and imanginative story. It follows the journey of Seiya, a boy born under the star of the Pegasus in his journey to find his little sister Seika. Before he can do any of that, he has to worry about the mission of the saints, to protect the goddess Athena from the conspiracy of Sanctuary. The coolest part of Saint Seiya is the fusion of **astrology and Greek lore.** You have the classic gods constantly making appearances, such as Poseidon and Hades in their own awe-inspiring desgins{Seriously, Hades design from Saint Seiya has to be my personal favorite interpretation of him ever. It manages to be captavating and beautiful while still keeping an air of terror and death about him.} The 12 Gold Saints are some of the highlights of the entire series, all powerful warriors that represent the 12 Zodiac signs. It makes for a unique experience, seeing which gold saint represents your zodiac sign make an appearance in the show. Don't be mistaken, however, Saint Seiya was made popular not just because of it's bold setting, but a variety of factors. Every episode, something new was happening, whether that be a new development in the plot or another crazy action scene was starting up. Additionally, the series was very brutal and gory compared to lots of other shonen works that came out around the time. Every fight would be accompained by scores of **blood, dismemberment, and gory deaths.** The tragedy and emotion that underlined many of the anime's big moments made the story gripping from start to finish. Special mention must be noted for it's anime adaptation that was masterfully directed by _Kozo Morishita_, and a mesmerizing soundtrack by _Seiji Yokoyama_ that genuinly makes every scene of the anime that much more impactful. Saint Seiya is a work that still sees spinoffs and success till this day because of it's unforgettable story and bombastic action scenes.
#### 3  The King of Braves:GaoGaiGar
![Key art of GaoGaiGar featuring Guy,Mamarou and the titular mech][Guy]
One genre has always remained extremely popular in anime, and that is mecha. And from mecha comes it's two main sub-genres, _real and super_. Real robot shows tend to be more politcial and grounded, and the robots used in the shows are more or less based off of real and believable technology. Super robot shows tend to be more fantastical and bombastic, and the robots don't run off conventional technology, but instead feelings,emotions or maybe even alien energy. The latter is the category [GaoGaiGar](https://myanimelist.net/anime/890/Yuusha-Ou_GaoGaiGar) falls under. It's part of a metaseries of mecha anime known as the "Braves" series, and GaoGaiGar was envisioned as the series swan song. It follows the adventures of **Cyborg Guy and his young companion Mamoru** as they use the power of the "G-Stone" and Galeon to fight the alien threat of the Zonders. What makes this show special is the passion that can be felt behind almost every episode. It's clear that everyone, from the sound designers,animators and writers, truly cared about the quality and messages of the series. The story is written to be inspiring, as it teaches the viewer what it means to have courage and be brave, as well as the dangers of stress relief and what it means to truly have a family. The characters, while most of them are not deep, are very endearing and fun to watch. Giant robot battles have never been more spectacular, as the GaoGaiGar uses giant tools such as hammers and pliers to pummel it's foes. Special mention goes to the **"Hell and Heaven"** for being one of the coolest finishing moves in anime history.
#### 4 Gundam Seed
![Key art of Gundam Seed featuring the Aile Strike and Aegis Gundams][Seed]
 Unlike GaoGaiGar before it, **Gundam** is a mecha anime that falls under the classification of a real robot show.Being the first Gundam anime to be animated with digital technology, [Gundam Seed](https://www.crunchyroll.com/mobile-suit-gundam-seed) had alot to prove when it first came out in 2002. It came off of the failures of both Turn A Gundam and After War:Gundam X. In a last ditch effort to save the franchise, studio Sunrise made many changes to the formula of the series. Hiring a new art director to give all of the characters a younger, more attractive appeal. The story also included much more drama and romance elements then previous shows, which did wonders in reaching a new audience of women and children. Those elements along with expert mecha desgin by _Okawara_ ensured Gundam Seed was a smash hit when it first came out. The anime featured plenty of action, drama and tension to the themes of **racism and ethnic conflicts.** Gundam Seed is an unforgettable story that many fans still revisit and talk about today, and the new movie based of the anime scheduled in 2023 will ignite that passion even more.
 #### 5 Hitman Reborn
 ![Key art featuring the core Vongola Family members][Vongola]
 Last but certainly not least is [Hitman Reborn!](https://www.crunchyroll.com/reborn) This anime follows the story of no-good Tsuna, who is a failure in practically every metric of his life. This all changes one day when **a baby**{Yes, really] appears one day and tells him he has to start training as the next successor of the **Vongola mafia family.** What follows is a story about self-betterment and the hard work it takes to not only become a better person, but how to take responsibility for the people that could be impacted by your decisions. Like Saint Seiya before it, Reborn has seen much of a cultural following due to the unique premise and cool characters seen within it. Characters fight using "Dying-Will Flames" that all correspond to the elements of _Sky, Storm, Rain, Sun, Lightning, Mist and Cloud._ The unique power system this anime uses gives fights more depths then most anime. And this is even more true when our characters get their "Box-Weapons" Pokemon-like creatures that can transform and change into powerful weapons. Unfortunately, much like GaoGaiGar, it's last story arc was never animated, and fans are hoping desperately that the story will be finished.
